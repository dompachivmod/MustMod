# MustMod RCON protocol

Server side: `Src\MustMod\Classes\MustModRCon.uc` (opcodes 23-61) (extends `AOCRCon`), spawned by the
`InitRemoteConsole` override in `Src\MustMod\Include\MustModGame.uci`.

**Status: limited testing in a development environment.** Tournament controls, loadout,
freeze, bans, map and the fun commands have been exercised on a live server; the fixes
made in response are noted per opcode below. Nothing has been load-tested.

## Why this exists

The ChivAdmin desktop client already speaks opcodes 0-28. Opcodes 0-22 match
`AOCRCon.uc`'s `MessageType` enum exactly, in order. **Opcodes 23-28 exist only in the
client** -- its Java classes for them are marked `implements CustomChivEvent`, whose
javadoc says "for non-vanilla CMW messages sent from the server. This is the case when
the 'ChivAdmin' mod is installed." That mutator was never published.

So implementing 23-28 makes an **unmodified ChivAdmin client** work against a MustMod
server. Every layout below was read off the client's own encoders/decoders, not guessed.

## Wire format (unchanged from vanilla)

Big-endian. `AOCRConPacket` provides:

    AddInt / GetInt        4-byte big-endian int
    AddString / GetString  4-byte length prefix, then UTF-8 bytes
    AddQWord / GetGUID     8-byte Steam ID
    SetMessageType(int)    takes a plain int, so custom opcodes need no enum change

Auth is untouched: challenge string, 50-byte password packet, `RCON_Connecting` ->
`RCON_Connected`. `MustModRCon.HandleMessage` checks `RCON_Connected` before dispatching
anything extended, so an unauthenticated peer reaches none of it.

## Opcodes

`in` = client to server. `out` = server to client.

### 0-22 -- vanilla, handled by AOCRCon, untouched

SERVER_CONNECT, SERVER_CONNECT_SUCCESS, PASSWORD, PLAYER_CHAT, PLAYER_CONNECT,
PLAYER_DISCONNECT, SAY_ALL, SAY_ALL_BIG, SAY, MAP_CHANGED, MAP_LIST, CHANGE_MAP,
ROTATE_MAP, TEAM_CHANGED, NAME_CHANGED, KILL, SUICIDE, KICK_PLAYER, TEMP_BAN_PLAYER,
BAN_PLAYER, UNBAN_PLAYER, ROUND_END, PING

One exception: **UNBAN_PLAYER (20) is intercepted** by `MustModRCon.HandleUnbanFixed`
before it reaches `super`. Vanilla's `AOCAccessControl.UnbanByUID` removes the entry
from the in-memory `Bans` array and stops -- it never calls `SaveConfig()`, while
`AddBan` does, so the ban is still sitting in the ini and comes back on the next server
start. The interception does the same removal, calls `SaveConfig()`, and audits whether
anything actually matched (vanilla's version was silent either way).

### 23-28 -- ChivAdmin parity, implemented here

Opcode **23 overrides `GameEvent_UpdatePing`**, it does not add a new hook. That is the
only ping entry point the game calls (`AOCPlayerController.uc:8446`); `AOCRCon` is native
and exposes nothing else, so a separately-named "extended" function would never run. It
replaces vanilla opcode 22 rather than sitting alongside it, matching what the ChivAdmin
mutator did, and the field order is theirs: uid, ping, score, idleTime, kills,
teamDamageDealt, rank. `AOCPRI.IdleTime` is a byte of quarter-scale seconds
(`AOCPRI.uc:558`), so it is multiplied by 4 on the way out and saturates at 1020s.

Opcode **48 (SOBER_PLAYER)** is MustMod-only and undoes 26. ChivAdmin's Inebriate carries
only a UID and is one-way; 26 is left wire-compatible with that rather than growing a flag.

### 49-50 -- tournament control

  * **49 SET_TOURNAMENT** `int enabled, int thresholdPercent (0 = leave)`
    Disable also clears `class'AOCGame'.default.bTournamentMode` and saves. `bTournamentMode`
    is globalconfig and InitGame re-reads it every map (AOCGame.uc:3337), so a runtime-only
    clear lets the mode come back after a map change and re-brick the pre-round. Enable is
    runtime-only on purpose.
  * **50 READY_ALL** `int ready (1 = ready all, 0 = clear all)`

**MustMod deliberately disabled vanilla's own tournament command.** `MustModGame.uci:137`
carries `// Deprecated` and an empty `function AdminTournamentMode(bool bEnable){}`, which
neuters `AOCGame.AdminTournamentMode` -- and that is no loss, because the vanilla version
writes the flag to config with `SaveConfig` and then calls
`WorldInfo.ServerTravel("?restart")`. In other words the in-game `AdminTournamentMode`
command does nothing on a MustMod server, and opcode 49 is not a duplicate of it but the
only working way to toggle the mode. Do not "restore" the vanilla behaviour without asking:
a map restart per toggle is exactly what was removed.

`bTournamentMode` gates `AOCGame.ShouldStartRound` (AOCGame.uc:3062), holding the pre-round
until each team reaches `TournamentTeamReadyThreshold` or `bAdminForcedTournamentReady` is
set. Two things the client has to state rather than hide:

  * It only bites during the pre-round.
  * **`StartRound` clears it** (AOCGame.uc:3099). TB's comment there says it "can't persist
    (since LTS reenters preround)", so it is one-shot per round start. Vanilla behaviour,
    not a bug to work around.

Opcode 49 also applies the side effects vanilla applies at InitGame when the mode is on
(AOCGame.uc:3344): autobalance off, ping limit off, team damage penalty disabled. A mid-match
toggle never ran InitGame, so without this "tournament mode over RCON" would quietly mean
something weaker than `?Tournament` on the command line. They are **not** reverted on
disable -- the server cannot know what it was originally configured with, and guessing would
silently rewrite an admin's settings.

Opcode 50 with `ready=1` is vanilla's `AdminReadyAll` (:5235), previously reachable only by
typing `!adminreadyall` in chat. `ready=0` has no vanilla equivalent and clears
`bAdminForcedTournamentReady` as well, which is what makes a re-match work -- otherwise the
gate stays latched open from the previous round.

### 62-64 -- muted player list

  * **62 MUTE_LIST_REQUEST** `(no body)`
  * **63 MUTE_INFO** `QWord uid, string name, int team, int online` -- one per stored mute
  * **64 MUTE_LIST_END** `int count`

Same request/burst/end shape as 29-31 and 39-41, and it closes the same gap 39-41 closed
for bans: opcode 42 could mute and unmute but nothing could *see* who was muted, so an
admin joining mid-match had no way to find out.

The list is the **stored** one, not a scan of connected players, so mutes on people who
have left are visible too. `online` is 1 when that uid is currently connected, in which
case `name` and `team` are live; for an offline entry `name` is whatever they were called
when muted and `team` is -1.

**Mutes persist.** `Mutes` is a `globalconfig array<MuteInfo>` on `MustModRCon`, holding
`UniqueNetId` + name exactly as `AOCAccessControl.Bans` does, saved to
`[MustMod.MustModRCon]` in `UDKGame.ini` on every change. Opcode 42 writes the entry and
`GameEvent_PlayerConnect` re-applies `bIsAdminMuted` as the player rejoins, so a mute is
no longer cleared by reconnecting or by a server restart.

Two consequences worth knowing. `SaveConfig()` runs on every mute change -- deliberate,
because `AOCAccessControl.UnbanByUID` drops the entry from its array and never saves,
which is why an unbanned player comes back banned after a restart. And 42 accepts a uid
that is not connected: with no PlayerController there is no flag to clear, but the stored
entry is still removed, otherwise a mute applied to someone who then left could never be
lifted. Bots are included if muted; their uid follows the usual `{A=0, B=PlayerID}`
stamping, and being per-match they will never match a stored entry.

### 60-61 -- teleport and slap

  * **60 TELEPORT** `QWord mover, QWord destination`
  * **61 SLAP** `QWord uid, int power` (clamped 50-2000 server-side, no damage)

Placement logic lives in `MustModAdminActions`. `Actor.SetLocation` is `native(267)` and
returns FALSE when the spot is taken, so `Teleport` walks a ring of eight positions around
the destination before giving up. Velocity is cleared on arrival. Both players must be
alive, and the failure reason is in the audit line.

The in-game `!bring` / `!goto` / `!slap` / `!pause` chat commands were removed by decision
on 2026-08-31 -- RCON covers all of it and the chat parser was not worth its surface area.

### 51-59 -- freeze, class, loadout, map

  * **51 SET_FROZEN** `QWord uid, int frozen`
  * **52 SET_CLASS** `QWord uid, int classIndex, int immediate`
  * **53 LOADOUT_REQUEST** `QWord uid` -> a burst of 54, then 55
  * **54 LOADOUT_OPTION** out `QWord uid, int slot, int index, string weapon`
  * **55 LOADOUT_END** out `QWord uid, int prim, int sec, int tert`
  * **56 SET_LOADOUT** `QWord uid, int prim, int sec, int tert` (-1 = leave that slot)
  * **57 PLAYER_POS_REQUEST** -> a burst of 58, then 59
  * **58 PLAYER_POS** out `QWord uid, string name, int team, int x, int y, int z, int yawDeg, int alive, int health`
  * **59 PLAYER_POS_END** out `int count`

**Freeze needs no new replication.** `AOCPlayerController.ScriptToggleInput` ->
`ClientScriptToggleInput` (:7572) is already a `reliable client function`; the
`ScriptBlockedInputs` array is not replicated but the RPC that writes it is. Read TB's
comment beside it before trusting this for anything: *"This isn't a safe way of preventing a
player from performing some action. It's intended for SP/Tutorials."* Enforcement is
client-side. Talk is deliberately left unblocked.

**Loadout is exchanged as indices, not names.** 53 walks
`AOCFamilyInfo.NewPrimaryWeapons/NewSecondaryWeapons/NewTertiaryWeapons` and sends each
entry's index; 56 sets by that index. No weapon class path crosses the wire, so the client
needs no content knowledge and the server never resolves a string it was handed.
`AltPrimaryWeapon` is carried through untouched -- it is not in the choice lists and
clobbering it would drop the alternate mode of whatever they hold. Server-side only:
`SetWeapons` is simulated and the normal flow is client-then-`S_SetWeapons`, so this sets
what the server will spawn them with, not what their own class menu shows.

**Positions are read live, not from the replicated copy.** `AOCPRI.PawnLocation` is only
refreshed on a 2s server timer (AOCPRI.uc:192); the handler already runs on the server, so
it takes `Pawn.Location` directly and falls back to `PawnLocation` for a player whose pawn is
gone. Yaw is converted to degrees on the way out so the client needs to know nothing about
UE3 rotator units.

**Inebriate is not TO2-only, and neither 26 nor 48 touches the sound mode.** Two things had
to be right:

  * `EnableDrunkSoundMode` is a plain function, so calling it from an RCON handler runs it on
    the *server's* copy of the controller, where its 1s repeating timer reaches for an audio
    device a dedicated server does not have. Both handlers now call only `ClientInebriate`;
    `AOCBaseHUD` drives the sound mode on the player's own machine from its fade.
  * The drunk effect is gated by the active post-process chain, not the map.
    `AOCBaseHUD.NotifyBindPostProcessEffects` looks up `'drunkeffect'` in
    `LocalPlayer.PlayerPostProcess`, and Torn Banner's comment beside it says "if the PPC
    doesn't have a drunk effect, this does nothing". The default chain is
    `CHV_PPC_Pack.ChivPostProcess_noToneMap`; the drunk nodes live in the sibling chain
    `ChivPostProcess_drunk` in the same base-game package. MustMod's `ClientInebriate`
    override **swaps the whole chain** and re-binds when the map has none of its own, using
    the engine's own idiom from `GameInfo.uc:1585-1592`:

        LP.RemoveAllPostProcessingChains();
        LP.InsertPostProcessingChain(<chain>, INDEX_NONE, true);
        PC.myHUD.NotifyBindPostProcessEffects();

    Appending instead of replacing is what the first attempt did, and it renders as heavy
    blocky smearing: `ChivPostProcess_drunk` is a *complete* chain, a sibling of
    `ChivPostProcess_noToneMap`, so leaving the map's chain in place runs two full chains
    back to back and uber-post-processes (tone map, bloom, motion blur) the scene twice.
    Sober-up restores `Engine.static.GetWorldPostProcessChain()` the same way, and only when
    MustMod was the one that swapped it.


| # | Name | Dir | Payload |
|---|------|-----|---------|
| 23 | PING_EXTENDED | out | qword uid, int ping, score, idleTime, kills, teamDamageDealt, rank |
| 24 | CHANGE_SCORE | in | qword uid, int score |
| 25 | KILL_PLAYER | in | qword uid |
| 26 | INEBRIATE | in | qword uid |
| 27 | CHANGE_GAME_PASSWORD | in | string password |
| 28 | CONSOLE_COMMAND | in | qword uid, int scope, string command |

Scope: `0` = game, `1` = that player, `2` = all players.

**23 is written but not wired.** Vanilla drives plain PING from
`GameEvent_UpdatePing`; hooking the extended one needs a decision on how often to emit a
packet per player. `idleTime` and `rank` are sent as 0 -- nothing in `AOCPRI` or
`PlayerReplicationInfo` tracks either, and inventing values would be worse than the gap.

### 29-37 -- MustMod additions

ChivAdmin ignores opcodes it does not know, so these cannot break it.

| # | Name | Dir | Payload |
|---|------|-----|---------|
| 29 | PLAYER_LIST_REQUEST | in | (empty) |
| 30 | PLAYER_INFO | out | qword uid, string name, int team, score, deaths, kills, ping, health, teamDamage, string class, int isSpectator |
| | | | ping is milliseconds (`PRI.Ping * 4`), matching opcode 23. Bots carry a synthetic uid: `{A=0, B=PlayerID}`. |
| 31 | PLAYER_LIST_END | out | int count |
| 32 | SET_TEAM | in | qword uid, int team |
| 33 | FORCE_SPECTATE | in | qword uid |
| 34 | SET_TEAM_SCORE | in | int team, int score |
| | | | LTS keeps the real score in `AOCLTS.RoundScores` and draws `AOCLTSGRI.RoundsWon`; `Teams[].Score` is a mirror rewritten from `RoundScores` at every round boundary (`AOCLTS.uc:216-219`, `:316`). All three are written. `AOCLTS.uc:331` tests `== GoalScore` after the increment, so a team set to the goal steps over it and never triggers the end. |
| 35 | ADMIN_AUDIT | out | string action, string detail |
| 36 | SERVER_INFO_REQUEST | in | (empty) |
| 37 | SERVER_INFO | out | string map, int numPlayers, maxPlayers, matchBegun, numSpectators |
| 38 | CONSOLE_RESULT | out | string command, string result |
| 39 | BAN_LIST_REQUEST | in | (empty) |
| 40 | BAN_INFO | out | qword uid, string name, string reason, int durationSeconds, string netIdString, string ipPolicy |
| 41 | BAN_LIST_END | out | int count |
| 42 | MUTE_PLAYER | in | qword uid, int mute |
| 43 | SET_PAUSE | in | int paused |
| | | | Goes to `AOCGame.SetPause`/`ClearPause`, not `PlayerController.SetPause` (MustMod's override there is admin-gated). `bPauseable` is forced on around the call: AOCGame inherits `bPauseable=False` from `UTGame.uc:3396`, and `bAdminCanPause=false` in UDKGame.ini, so `AllowPausing` refused every pause until this. In-game `unpause` only clears a pause the same controller set, so it cannot undo this -- unpause over RCON. |
| 44 | END_MATCH | in | int winningTeam, string reason |
| 45 | SET_AUTOBALANCE | in | int enabled |
| 46 | SET_GAME_SPEED | in | int speedPercent (100 = normal, clamped 10-400) |
| 47 | RESTART_MATCH | in | (empty) |

**46 exists rather than routing through 28** because `AOCGame.SetGameSpeed` notifies
every client via `NotifySpeedChanged` and republishes `AOCGRI.Speed`, which a bare
`GameInfo.ConsoleCommand` does not do. That is exactly why the old relay carried its own
SLOMO verb. Clamped 10-400%: a speed of zero stops the match with no way to type the
command that would restore it.

**38 is the one that changes how RCON feels.** `Actor.ConsoleCommand` returns the
command's output as a string and vanilla throws it away, so every *query* command was
invisible to an admin. Opcode 28 now captures it and replies with 38, which makes RCON
a real console rather than a fire-and-forget pipe. Empty results are still sent so a
client can always pair a response to its request.

**39-41 fixes a genuine vanilla gap:** RCON could unban but had no way to *see* the ban
list, so unbanning meant already knowing the uid. `AOCAccessControl.Bans` carries name,
reason and duration for exactly this reason.

**42** sets `AOCPRI.bIsAdminMuted` directly rather than calling
`ServerAdminMutePlayer`, which gates on the *caller's* `bAdmin` -- the console has no
PRI, so that path could never authorise it. The RCON password is the authorisation.

**43** borrows a PlayerController to own the pause (an admin if one is connected),
because `GameInfo.SetPause` requires one and the console has none.

**44** converts a team index into the winning PRI via
`AOCGame.GetHighestScoreFromTeam`, since `EndGame` wants a PRI. An empty team ends the
match with no winner rather than failing silently.

29 replies with a burst of 30s then a 31. Kills come from `AOCPRI.NumKills`, not
`PlayerReplicationInfo.Kills` -- AOCPRI's own comment says `Kills` is not replicated.

## CONSOLE_COMMAND is the important one

Scope 1 runs against the **server-side** controller for that player, so it reaches
server functions and admin execs. It does not execute on their machine.

That single opcode exposes everything MustMod already has without a per-command opcode:
`AdminKick`, `AdminKickBan`, `AdminUnban`, `AdminBanNetID`, `AdminChangeTeam`,
`AdminCoinFlip`, `AdminReadyAll`, `AdminCancelVote`, `AdminTournamentMode`,
`AdminToggleParryBox`, `AdminEnableSkeletalParry`,
`AdminForceSpectate`, `AdminForceSpectateAll`, `ce`, and anything added later.

It is also arbitrary execution against a live server, gated only by the RCON password.

Because scope 1 runs in the server's process, `quit` on a player quits the **server** --
confirmed in testing. `MustModBlockedConsoleCommands` (config, `[MustMod.MustModRCon]` in
UDKGame.ini) refuses the first token of a command; defaults are `quit`, `exit`, `debug`.

## Auditing

Every state-changing command calls `MustModAudit(Action, Detail)`, which:

  * logs via `LogAlwaysInternal` (not the log macro -- FINAL_RELEASE makes `LogInternal`
    private and the macro stops compiling), and
  * emits opcode 35 so any connected client sees it too.

Passwords are never logged; opcode 27 records only "set" or "cleared". This is
deliberate: admin power on this server should be visible rather than quiet.

Not yet done: an in-game notification for destructive actions. `22603c3` already added
admin command logging in-game, so there is a pattern to extend.

## Client (C:\Projects\ChivRcon)

.NET 8, three projects. `ChivRcon.Core` speaks the protocol; `ChivRcon.App` is the
WinForms UI; `ChivRcon.Tests` is a self-contained runner.

Its opcode table already matched 0-28 exactly, so the parity work needed no client
changes at all. Added since: opcodes 29-47 in `RconMessageType`, the matching send
methods and parse cases in `RconClient`, and event records in `RconEvents`.

**The relay is gone.** `RelayClient.cs` spoke a separate text protocol on its own port,
served by a `ChivRelay` ServerActor, and existed solely to reach three things native
RCON could not: console commands, text mute, and game speed. Those are now opcodes 28,
42 and 46, so the whole second connection -- port field, status label, reconnect timer,
connect/disconnect lifecycle -- was removed along with its integration tests. Old
settings files carrying `RelayPort` still load; unknown JSON properties are ignored.

One naming fix worth knowing: the client's `ConsoleCommandScope` used to read
`Server / Client / All`. Scope 1 does **not** run on the player's machine -- it runs on
their server-side controller -- so it now reads `Game / Player / AllPlayers`, matching
ChivAdmin's own naming and the server.

## Adding an opcode

1. `const RCONX_YOURTHING = 38;` in `MustModRCon.uc`.
2. A `case` in `HandleMessage`'s extended switch.
3. A handler that reads with `GetGUID`/`GetInt`/`GetString` **in the order the client
   writes them** and calls `MustModAudit` if it changes state.
4. Document it in the table above.

Unknown opcodes are logged and ignored, never fatal -- a newer client cannot drop the
connection.

### `SAY_ALL_BIG` (opcode 7) was never a big message

`AOCRCon.uc:143` falls both broadcast opcodes through to one handler:

    case MessageType.SAY_ALL:
    case MessageType.SAY_ALL_BIG:
        HandleSayAll(Packet);

`HandleSayAll` only calls `BroadcastMessage`, so "say big" was a second chat line and
nothing else. `AOCBaseHUD.Announce` looks like the intended path but its body is
commented out (`AOCBaseHUD.uc:961`), so `PC.Announce()` does nothing at all.

The only vanilla route that puts arbitrary text on screen is the objective header
banner: `AOCPlayerController.ClientShowLocalizedHeaderText` ->
`AOCBaseHUD.AddHeaderText`, which the stock game uses for CTF and Duel headers.
`MustModRCon.HandleSayAllBig` intercepts opcode 7 the same way `UNBAN_PLAYER` is
intercepted, calls that on every `AOCPlayerController`, and still broadcasts the chat
line, because the banner clears itself after a few seconds and the chat line is the
record. Audited as `SAY_ALL_BIG`.

Clients need no mod for this -- the header banner is stock; only the server has to be
running this build.

## Three vanilla traps, found the hard way

These are worth reading before adding anything that moves players or silences them.

### `WorldInfo.Game.ChangeTeam(PC, num, ...)` does not change teams

`AOCGame.ChangeTeam` (AOCGame.uc:1618) ignores `num` completely apart from a `< 255`
test:

    NewTeam = (num < 255) ? Teams[AOCPlayerController(Other).CurrentFamilyInfo.FamilyFaction] : ObserverTeam;

The team is read back off the player's own `CurrentFamilyInfo`, so it always resolves to
the team they are already on, hits the "check if already on this team" branch, and
returns false. `ServerChangeTeam(N)` is no better -- `AOCPlayerController.ChangeToNewTeam`
calls it with `CurrentFamilyInfo.FamilyFaction` anyway.

The only thing that moves a player is changing `CurrentFamilyInfo` first. The one place
in the stock game that force-swaps a live player is `AOCGame.PerformDeathBasedAB`
(AOCGame.uc:4962), and `MustModForceTeam` follows it:

  1. `NewFamily = AOCGRI.FamilyInfos[ClassReference]`, `+5` for Mason. The array is
     laid out 0-4 Agatha, 5-9 Mason, indexed by `ClassReference`.
  2. `PC.ClientAutoBalance(NewFamily)` -- clears the client's pending team selection and
     updates its HUD.
  3. `PC.SetNewClass(NewFamily, false, true)` -- `bForceSwitch = true` (autobalance passes
     false) is what sets `bMarkNewTeam` and kills the current pawn, so the swap lands now
     instead of on next respawn.
  4. `AOCPRI.MyFamilyInfo = none`.
  5. `PC.ServerChangeTeam(NewFamily.FamilyFaction)` -- only now does `ChangeTeam` resolve
     to the other team.

A player who has not picked a class yet has no `CurrentFamilyInfo` and cannot be swapped;
opcode 32 audits `SET_TEAM_FAILED` in that case rather than failing silently.

### `bIsAdminMuted` alone does not mute anyone

The flag replicates fine (`AOCPRI.uc:128`, on `bNetDirty`), but the only chat-side
consumer is `AOCPlayerController.ReceiveChatMessage` (:3502) -- i.e. **on each receiving
client**, and it is skipped in two cases:

  * the receiver has the sender on their Steam friends list (`SteamFriendPRI`), and
  * the message is the sender's own copy (`PRI != PlayerReplicationInfo`).

So a muted player still watches their own chat go through, which is exactly what mute
looking broken looks like when testing. `ServerAdminMutePlayer` (:7304) sets the flag and
has its `UpdateGameplayMuteList` follow-up commented out, so nothing else covers it.

`MustModGame.BroadcastMessage` now drops the message server-side before it reaches the
wire, and tells the sender they are muted. VOIP was already covered -- `AOCGame.uc:2198`
checks the flag when building voice channels.

### The ban list is server-side, and that is fine

`AOCAccessControl.Bans` is `globalconfig array<BanInfo>`, so it only exists in the
server's ini and no client can read it directly. Opcodes 39-41 walk the array **on the
server** and send one `BAN_INFO` per entry, so exposing it is entirely feasible -- the
client just never had a way to ask before. `ChivRcon.App/BanManagerDialog.cs` is the UI:
refresh, select, unban, with the server's audit line reported back in the dialog.

Note `KickBanGlobal` -> `AddBan` stores both the NetID **and** an IP policy
(`DENY,<addr>`) in the same `BanInfo`, so removing the entry lifts both. An IP-only ban
with no UID cannot be lifted by opcode 20; the dialog greys that case out.

## Untested, in rough risk order

  * The C# client changes have not been compiled -- no .NET SDK was reachable from this
    session. `BanManagerDialog.cs` is a new file in `ChivRcon.App`.
  * `MustModForceTeam` against a player who is mid-respawn, in a vehicle, or a King class
    (`FamilyInfos` only covers the five standard classes).
  * `AC.Bans.Remove(i, 1)` + `SaveConfig()` from outside `AOCAccessControl` -- legal
    UnrealScript, but the write happens on whatever ini `AOCAccessControl` is configured
    to, not necessarily the one being edited by hand.
  * Opcode 30's field order against the client's parse (now read by the player list).
  * `Pawn.Died` for opcode 25 -- taken from an existing `AOCGame` call site, but not
    exercised from an RCON context.
