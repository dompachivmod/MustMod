# MustMod 165Hz Server Optimization Guide

## Current Performance Bottlenecks (Dark Forest Final Objective)

**Problem:** Server ms spikes above 8.33ms budget on final objective with 18 standing NPCs.

**Root Cause:** 18 NPCs × 3Hz × 12 players = 648 NPC updates/second consuming server CPU.

---

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. NPC NetUpdateFrequency Reduction ✅

**MustModNPC_New_NoMove.uc** (Standing NPCs - Final Objective Targets)
```unrealscript
NetUpdateFrequency = 1.0  // Down from vanilla 3.0Hz (66% reduction)
```
- **Impact:** 648 updates/sec → 216 updates/sec = **432 fewer updates/second**
- **Rationale:** Standing NPCs only need updates when hit (handled by bForceNetUpdate)
- **Usage:** Replace `AOCNPC_New_NoMove` spawns with `MustModNPC_New_NoMove` in map Kismet

**MustModNPC_New.uc** (Moving NPCs - Patrols/Combat AI)
```unrealscript
NetUpdateFrequency = 30.0  // Down from vanilla 50.0Hz (40% reduction)
```
- **Impact:** 40% less network overhead per moving NPC
- **Rationale:** 30Hz is still smooth for AI, players get 165Hz for competitive feel
- **Usage:** Replace `AOCNPC_New` spawns with `MustModNPC_New` in map Kismet

---

## Recommended Map-Level Optimizations

### Option A: Use MustMod NPC Classes in Kismet
**Location:** Dark Forest map Kismet sequences (final objective)

**Change Kismet Spawn Actions:**
1. Open Dark Forest map in UDK Editor
2. Find final objective NPC spawn sequences
3. Change spawn class from `AOCNPC_New_NoMove` → `MustModNPC_New_NoMove`
4. Recompile map and test

**Expected Result:** Server ms drops from ~10-12ms → ~7-8ms on final objective

### Option B: Reduce NPC Count (If map can't be modified)
- Reduce 18 NPCs → 12 NPCs (33% reduction)
- Adjust objective requirement accordingly
- **Impact:** 648 updates → 432 updates (33% reduction)

## Additional Server Performance Tips

### 1. Server Config Optimizations
**File:** `UDKGame\Config\PCServer-UDKEngine.ini`

```ini
[Engine.GameEngine]
; 165Hz dedicated server tickrate
NetServerMaxTickRate=165
MaxClientRate=25000
MaxInternetClientRate=25000

; Reduce physics substeps on server (doesn't affect client)
MaxPhysicsSubsteps=2
bUsePhysicsAsync=FALSE

; Reduce bandwidth for spectators (non-players)
MaxSpectatorRate=8000

[IpDrv.TcpNetDriver]
; Network optimization for 165Hz
NetServerMaxTickRate=165
InitialConnectTimeout=200.0
ConnectionTimeout=80.0
```

### 2. Map-Specific Optimizations
- **Ragdolls:** Already optimized in MustModPawn (client-only, 0.5s remove)
- **Projectiles:** Consider reducing arrow/throwable lifetime
- **Particles:** Reduce particle count on blood/hit effects for server
- **Audio:** Server doesn't need to calculate positional audio (already disabled)

### 3. Objective Design Best Practices
**For map makers:**
- Limit standing NPCs to **12 max** per objective (< 300 updates/sec)
- Stagger NPC spawns across multiple waves instead of all at once
- Use `bAlwaysRelevant=false` for NPCs far from players
- Consider proximity-based NPC activation (spawn when players approach)

## Performance Monitoring Commands

**Check server performance (Admin only):**
```
StartPollingServerTickTime  // Shows real-time server ms in scoreboard
GetServerTickTime           // One-time server ms check
stat fps                    // Client FPS (should be 120+ with vsync off)
stat net                    // Network stats (bandwidth, packet loss)
```

**Target Metrics:**
- **Server ms:** < 6.06ms (165Hz = 6.06ms budget per tick)
- **Player NetUpdateFrequency:** 165Hz (MustModPawn, MustModPlayerController)
- **NPC NetUpdateFrequency:** 1-30Hz (MustModNPC classes)
- **Player ping:** < 70ms optimal, < 140ms acceptable

## Testing Checklist

**Before deploying optimizations:**
1. ✅ Compile MustModNPC_New.uc and MustModNPC_New_NoMove.uc
2. ✅ Update Dark Forest map Kismet to use MustMod NPC classes
3. ✅ Test final objective with 12 players + 18 NPCs
4. ✅ Verify server ms stays under 8.33ms during combat
5. ✅ Confirm NPCs still take damage and replicate properly
6. ✅ Check client-side smoothness (should see no change)

**Success Indicators:**
- Server ms < 6.06ms on all objectives (including final)
- No visible jitter or lag on NPC deaths
- Trade window still functions correctly (165Hz player updates maintained)
- Combat feels identical to previous optimizations (low latency)

---

## Rollback Plan

**If optimizations cause issues:**
1. Revert Dark Forest map to vanilla NPC spawns
2. Increase MustModNPC NetUpdateFrequency:
   - NoMove: 1.0 → 2.0Hz
   - Moving: 30.0 → 40.0Hz
3. Reduce player count temporarily (12 → 10 players)
4. Contact MustMod dev for troubleshooting

## Future Optimizations (Not Yet Implemented)

**Low Priority:**
- Actor relevancy distance tuning (cull distant actors sooner)
- Projectile pooling (reuse arrow actors instead of spawn/destroy)
- Animation tick reduction (reduce non-visible pawn anim ticks)
- Physics async enable (risky, needs extensive testing)

**Not Recommended:**
- ❌ Reducing player NetUpdateFrequency below 165Hz (defeats competitive purpose)
- ❌ Disabling ragdolls entirely (already optimized to client-only)
- ❌ Increasing server tickrate above 165Hz (diminishing returns, more CPU)

## Technical Notes

**Why 1Hz for standing NPCs?**
- They don't move (PHYS_None)
- Only replicate when hit (bForceNetUpdate in TakeDamage)
- 1Hz keeps them "alive" for relevancy checks
- Damage replication is instant (bForceNetUpdate bypasses normal updates)

**Why 30Hz for moving NPCs?**
- Balance between smoothness and performance
- Human eye perceives smooth motion at ~24fps
- 30Hz network updates = smooth enough for AI
- 165Hz reserved for player pawns (competitive advantage)

**Network Math:**
```
Vanilla Final Objective (18 NPCs):
18 NPCs × 3Hz × 12 players = 648 updates/sec

Optimized Final Objective (18 NPCs):
18 NPCs × 1Hz × 12 players = 216 updates/sec

Savings: 432 updates/sec (66% reduction)
```

**Server Tick Budget:**
```
165Hz tickrate = 6.06ms per tick

At 60% load:
- Player updates: ~5ms (12 players × 165Hz)
- NPC updates: ~1ms (18 NPCs × 1Hz)
- Game logic: ~2ms (objectives, spawns, etc)
= ~8ms total (within budget)
```
