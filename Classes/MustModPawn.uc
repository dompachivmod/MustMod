class MustModPawn extends AOCPawn;

// MUSTMOD: Parry rollback — "decide once" netcode.
// An incoming melee swing is HELD on the defender for a latency-sized window (the time an
// in-flight parry could still take to reach the server). Nothing is applied during the hold,
// so a parry that lands inside the window suppresses the swing before any feedback plays —
// no commit-then-refund. At 0 ping the hold is 0 and the hit resolves instantly (vanilla).
// Defined here in the base class (not the .uci include) so every subclass shares one
// PendingHit type rather than each getting its own copy.

// MUSTMOD: Client-timestamp hit-trade priority. Each client stamps the moment its hit landed
// (or its parry went active) in its own clock; the server maps those stamps onto its own
// timeline (ping reconstruction + a smoothed per-player offset) so it can tell who acted first
// and drop only clearly-staggered trades — near-simultaneous swings still trade. See the
// helpers and arbitration in MustMod/Include/MustModPawn.uci. Declared here (base class) so
// every subclass shares one struct type, matching PendingHit above.
