/**
* MustMod combat bot — drop-in replacement for AOCAICombatController that makes "addbots"
* bots noticeably less dumb in melee, with zero changes to the AI's decision logic. Only two
* low-risk levers are pulled:
*
*  1. SKILL FLOOR. Vanilla bots default to fSkill=0.6, and AOCAICombatController.ChooseBehaviour()
*     OVERWRITES fSkill from AOCGame.GameDifficulty at spawn whenever GameDifficulty != 0 — so
*     setting fSkill in DefaultProperties alone is silently clobbered on most servers. We override
*     ChooseBehaviour to call super first, then raise fSkill up to a floor. It's a floor, not a
*     hard set, so an admin who deliberately runs a higher GameDifficulty keeps their value.
*     fSkill feeds the bot's SkillRoll()/SkillBlur() everywhere: parry success, feint reads,
*     attack quality, decision sharpness.
*
*  2. THREAT AWARENESS. The "menacing" detection vars (how wide an angle / how far out an
*     incoming swing is noticed, and how fast threat escalates after being hit) are never touched
*     at runtime, so tuning them in DefaultProperties is reliable. Slightly widening/lengthening
*     detection gives the bot a fairer chance to react and parry instead of eating free hits.
*
* Everything else (positioning, aggression, attack-direction randomness) is left at vanilla to
* avoid bots over-committing or running into walls. Tune fMustModMinSkill / the menacing vars
* below to taste. Wired in via DefaultAIControllerClass in MustMod/Include/MustModGame.uci.
