/**
* MustMod standing NPC (final-objective targets / stationary AI).
*
* Netcode optimization over AOCNPC_New_NoMove:
*  - bAlwaysRelevant=false + NetCullDistanceSquared: standing NPCs far from every player stop
*    replicating entirely (vanilla force-replicates all of them to everyone). This is the big
*    win for objectives that pack many standing NPCs — players at the objective are unaffected,
*    distant players simply don't receive them.
*  - NetUpdateFrequency reduced 3 -> 1Hz. Standing NPCs barely change, and TakeDamage (inherited
*    from AOCNPC_New_NoMove) already forces an immediate net update on hit, so the low idle rate
*    costs nothing in responsiveness.
*
* Usage: swap AOCNPC_New_NoMove spawns for MustModNPC_New_NoMove in map Kismet. Tune
* NetCullDistanceSquared up if an objective needs these visible/hittable from farther away.
