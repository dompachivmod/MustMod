/**
* MustMod moving NPC (patrols / combat AI).
*
* Netcode optimization over AOCNPC_New:
*  - bAlwaysRelevant=false + NetCullDistanceSquared: NPCs far from every player are no longer
*    replicated at all (vanilla force-replicates them to everyone regardless of distance). This
*    is a pure server-CPU/bandwidth win for crowded objectives on large maps — players fighting
*    near the NPCs are unaffected; only players across the map (beyond the cull radius) stop
*    receiving them.
*  - NetUpdateFrequency reduced 50 -> 30Hz (still smooth for AI; players keep 120Hz).
*
* Usage: swap AOCNPC_New spawns for MustModNPC_New in map Kismet. Tune NetCullDistanceSquared
* up if any objective requires seeing/hitting these NPCs from farther than the radius below.
